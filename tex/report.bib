  abstract   = {A theorem related to the accumulation of Householder transformations into a single orthogonal transformation known as the compact WY transform is presented. It provides a simple characterization of the computation of this transformation and suggests an alternative algorithm for computing it. It also suggests an alternative transformation, the UT transform, with the same utility as the compact WY Transform which requires less computation and has similar stability properties. That alternative transformation was first published over a decade ago but has gone unnoticed by the community.},

    abstract = { A product \$Q = P\_1 \cdots P\_r \$, of \$m \times m\$ Householder matrices can be written in the form \$Q = I + WY^T \$, where W and Y are each \$m \times r\$. This is called the \$WY\$ representation of Q. It is of interest when implementing Householder techniques in high-performance computing environments that are especially good at matrix-matrix multiplication. In this note a storage-efficient way to implement the \$WY\$ representation is described. In particular, it is shown how the matrix Q can be expressed in the form \$Q = I + YTY^T \$, where \$Y \in R^{m \times r} \$ and \$T \in R^{r \times r} \$ with T upper triangular. Usually \$r \ll m\$ and so this “compact” \$WY\$ representation requires less storage. When compared with the recent block-reflector strategy proposed by Schreiber and Parlett [SIAM J. Numer. Anal, 25 (1988), pp. 189–205], the new technique still has a storage advantage and involves a comparable amount of work. }
